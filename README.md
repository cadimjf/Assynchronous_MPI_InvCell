In this work, we address an inverse problem related to cardiac cell modeling,
implemented through a parallel genetic algorithm. The objective of this work is
adapt this algorithm to run on a computational grid. computational grid is
an environment for running parallel applications, which has a large number of machines,
with great processing and storage power. The main motivation is to explore
these resources available, as the execution time on few machines is unsatisfactory. They are
covered all the services offered by the grid and how to use them. is also presented
all the steps for adapting the algorithm and the performance obtained.
